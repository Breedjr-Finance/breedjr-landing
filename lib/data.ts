Upon receipt of the withdrawal request, Breedjr will: (i) deduct your User Account balance; and (ii) initiate an on-chain transfer to an external wallet designated by you. Breedjr may not process a withdrawal request if, in our reasonable opinion, we consider that Applicable Law prevents the execution of the relevant withdrawal.
